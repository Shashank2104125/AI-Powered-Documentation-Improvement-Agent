 User Guide: Exploring the Number of Notifications Received by Users
====================================================================

In this guide, we'll show you how to use MoEngage Analytics to analyze the number of notifications received by your users. This information is crucial for growth teams to ensure they're sending the right number of push notifications and emails to their customers.

**Why Analyze Notification Frequency?**

Push notifications play a significant role in marketing, and it's essential that users receive them. Sending too many notifications can drive users to uninstall the app, while sending too few may not engage them enough. Regular analysis of notification frequency can help prevent this.

**How to Analyze Notification Frequency with MoEngage Analytics**

To analyze notification frequency, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Analytics** > **Behaviour**.
2. Select **Notification Received Android** as an event.
3. Choose **Total events per user** as the Analysis type and **Distribution** as the Aggregation type in the Behavior Options. Click on **Apply**.

This analysis will show you the number of times each user has received a notification, from the bottom 10 percentile users who receive 1 notification, to the 90th percentile users who receive 15 notifications in the last 7 days.

**Customizing the Distribution**

You can modify the distribution bucket based on your desired analysis to see how many users are receiving too many notifications or a specific number of notifications. You can view the user count for the selected bucket at the hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly level, or for the entire time duration.

**Optimizing Notification Frequency**

The ideal number of notifications varies depending on the industry and app content/services. Growth marketers should analyze:

- Users who receive more notifications and whether they're uninstalling.
- Users who receive fewer notifications and whether they're engaging enough.
- Users who receive an average number of notifications and whether they're converting.

With this analysis, you can take the necessary steps to control the number of notifications and optimize for these metrics and the overall user experience.

**Additional Questions to Answer**

You can also use MoEngage Analytics to answer other questions, such as:

- How many times do users open the app?
- How many users are repeat buyers?
- How many users open the app or buy too infrequently?
- What was the highest number of purchases per user for last month?

**Glossary**

- **Percentile**: A statistical measure that divides a range of values into 100 equal parts.
- **Aggregation type**: A method used to group data in analytics.

**Example**

For example, in the retail industry, it might be appropriate to send more notifications to users who have abandoned their shopping carts, while in the finance industry, users might prefer fewer notifications about account updates. By analyzing notification frequency, you can tailor your marketing strategy to your specific audience.
